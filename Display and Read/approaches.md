**No. of approaches to develop Python program for Problem Soling:**
- In python programming, we have two approaches to solving any python program. They are
  - Interactive mode
  - Batch mode
  
**a) interactive mode:**
- This mode of development, The programmer will issue one statement at a timeand obtains result for that statement.
- This is most useful for testing one statement at a time.
- This mode of development is not recommended for Real Time Appkication solving.
- Example : __Python Command Prompt__(By default available when we install python).

**b) batch mode:**
- In this mode of development, as programmer, we develop / write group of statements for solving any problem and save the group of statements in one file name with an extension .py (filename.py--->Source code)
- These mode of approach can be used by using the following.
    - Python IDLE (By default available when we install python)
    - EdutPlus
    - PyCharm
    - Jupyter note Book 
    - Spyder...etc
- To execute the python program explicitly, we use a tool called "python" or "py" and it's present in c:\User\Name\AppData\Local\programs\python\python
- Syntax for executing python program with "python" tool.
    - python filename.py (OR) py filename.py
