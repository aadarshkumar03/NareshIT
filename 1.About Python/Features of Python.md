**Python Programming Language have 11 Features:** <br>
**1.Simple:** 
- Python is one of the simple programming language because of 3-technical features. They are <br>
a) Python provides Rich set of API's. so that python programmer can re-use pre-defined functions for dealing with Industry Requirement without writing the source code by the programmer.<br>
_Def. of API (Application Programming Interface):_ 
An API is a collection of modules. A module is a collection of Functions, Variables and Classes.<br>
Example: random, math, cmath, calendar,....etc.<br>
b) Python programming Language provides in-built facility called "Garbage Collector" and whose purpose is collecting un-used memory space and improves performance of python based applications.<br>
_Def of Garbage Collector:_ It is one of the in-built program in python software, which is running behind our regular program and whose purpose is collecting un-used memory space and improves performance of python based Applications.<br>
c) Python programming provides user-firendly syntaxes so that python programmer develops error-free program in limited span of time.

**2.Free Ware and Open Source:**
- Since python software is freely downlodable from www.python.org hence python is FreeWare.
- Open source software is nothing but customizing the original software by many product / project based companies for In-house Development.
- The standard python developed by "ROSSUM" and maintained by "PSF" is "CPYTHON". Later days many companies came forward and customized "CPYTHON" and released to the industry on different Names and They are called "Distribution of Python".

**3.Platform Independant:** 
- A language is said to be platform independent iff whose applications runs on every OS.
- The property of platform independent in python is that "ALL VALUES IN PYTHON ARE STORED IN THE FORM OF OBJECTS".
- In python all objects contains un-limited  data and hence python objects are independent to all OSes.
- C,CPP are platform dependent.Java also platform independent but with limited memory space.

**4.Dynamically Typed:** 
- We have two types of programming languages "Static Typed" and "Dynamically Typed" programming language.
- In Static Typed programming, It is mandatory to specify the Data type for the Value of we are Storing. (C,CPP,Java....etc.)
- In Dynamic Typed programming, It is optional to specify the Data type of the value we are storing and whose Data type is specified by Python Environment automatically on the type of values we are storing.

**5.Portable:** 
- The portable applications / projects are those which are running on all OSes and processors without considering their vendors.
Examples: java,python---Portable and C,CPP...etc.---Non-Portable.

**6.Interpreted:** 
- When we execute python program two internal operations takes place. They are<br>
  a)Python Compiler Reads the source code and converted into Intermediate code called _"Byte Code"_ Line by Line _(Compilation Phase)_.<br>
  b)The PVM reads the _"Byte Code"_ and converted it into machine understandable code _"(Binary Code)"_ , which is processed by OS and Processor and Gives Result (Line by Line).
- Since the python compiler and PVM reads _Line by Line_ python program hence python is one of the _Interpreted_ Programming Language.

**7.High Level:**
- In python programming language even though we store the data in _Lower Level Values_ but the result is always showing in _Higher Level Values_ and hence python is one of the High Level programming language.

**8.Extensible:** 
- Non-python programming language can call the code of python language and hence python is one of the "Extensible Programming Language".

**9.Embedded:**
- Python program can also call non-python programming code (c-code) in the case of Internal Execution and hence python is one of the "Embedded programming Language".

**10.Extensive Third Party API Support:**
- The traditional python programmong can use _Third Party APIs_ such as NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, SciKit, MatpplotLib,...etc.
- To use there APIs / Module / Libraries, we use tool PIP / PIP 3.10 / PIP.
