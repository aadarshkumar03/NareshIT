**Types of Languages in Functions:**
- In this context, we have two types of PRogramming languages. They are
     1. Un-Structured Programming Languages
     2. Structured Programming Languages

**1.Un-Structured Programming Language:**
- In Un-Structured programming Languages, we don't have the concept of _"FUNCTIONS_".
<pre>Example:GW-BASIC

- The limitation of Un-Structured Programming languages are:
  1) Application Development time is more.
  2) Application Memory Space is more.
  3) Application Execution Time is more.
  4) Application Performance is Degraded.
  5) Redundency of code is more.
- To overcome these problems, we use structured programming languages which provides "FUNCTIONS".</pre>

**2.Structured Programming Languages:**
- In structured programming languages, We have the concept of _"FUNCTIONS_".
<pre>Example: Python, etc...

- The Advantages of Structured Programming Languages are :
  1) Application Development Time is Less.
  2) Application Memory Space is Less.
  3) Application Execution Time is Fast / Less.
  4) Application Performance is Enhanced.
  5) Application of Code is Minimized.</pre>
