**Rules for using Variables in Python:** <br>
1) The variable name is a combination of alphabates, Digits and Special Symbol(__).
2) The first letter of the variable must starts with either an alphabet (or) Underscore(__).
3) Within variable Name, special symbols are not allowed except underscore(__).
4) No Keywords is used as variable Names because all keywords are the reserved words and they have some special meaning to the compiler and PVM.
5) All variables in python are "Case Sensitive".
6) It is always recommended to take short user-friendly variable Names.
