- In python programming, we have two types of copy mechanisms, They are:
    - Deep copy
    - Shallow Copy
 **1. Deep Copy:**<br>
 - In Deep copy,
    - Initial Content of objects are same.
    - Address of objects are same.
    - Changes / Updation are reflected to each other (OR) changes / updation dependant.
- To implement Deep copy process, we use assignment operator (=).
- **Syntax: obj2=obj2 #Deep Copy.**

**2. Shallow Copy:**<br>
- In Shallow copy,
    - Initial Content of objects are same.
    - Address of objects are different.
    - Changes / Updation are not reflected to each other (OR) changes / updation are Independent.
- **Syntax: obj2=obj1.copy() #Shallow Copy.**
