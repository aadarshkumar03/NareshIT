**1.int:** <br>
-'int' is one of the pre-defined class and treated as "Fundamental Data Type".<br>
-The purpose of 'int' data type is to store Integer Data (OR) Whole Numbers (OR) Integral Values [Numbers without decimal Values].<br>
-with 'int' data type we can store "ALL TYPES OF NUMBER SYMTEM VALUES".

**Number System:** <br>
-We have Four types of Number Systems. They are<br>
_a)Decimal Number System:_ <br>
-It is one of the default Number System. Digits in Decimal Numbers = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and Base = 10.<br>
_b)Binary Number System:_ <br>
-Digits in Binary Number System = 0,1 and Base = 2.<br>
-To store Binary data, Binary data must preceded with either "0b" (OR) "0B".<br>
_c)Octal Number System:_ <br>
-Digits in Octal Number System = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and Base = 8.<br>
-To store Octal Data, Octal data must be preceded with either "0o" (OR) "0O".<br>
_d)Hexa Decimal Number System:_ <br>
-Digits in Hexa Decimal Number System = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A(10),B(11),C(13),D(14),F(15) and Base = 16.<br>
-To store Hexa Decimal Data, Hexa Decimal Data must be preceded with either "0x" (OR) "0X".<br>
_Note:All Types of Number System Values are internally converted into Decimal Number System value and it is treated as <class,'int'>_.

**Base Conversation Functions:** <br>
-The purpose of Base Conversation Function is that "To convert One Base Value to another Base Value".<br>
-In otherwords, Base conversation Functions are used for converting one Number System Value into another Number System Value.<br>
-We have 3 base conversation functions, They are:<br>
_a)bin():_ This Function is used for converting Decimal / Octal / Hexa Decimal values into Binary Value.<br>
_b)oct():_ This function is used for converting Decimal / Binary / Hexa Decimal values into Octal Value.<br>
_c)hex():_ This function is used for converting Decimal / Binary / Octal values into Hexa Decimal Value.<br>
