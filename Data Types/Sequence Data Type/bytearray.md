**bytearray:**<br>
-'bytearray' is one of the pre-defined Data type and treated as Sequence Data Type.<br>
-The purpose of bytearray data type is that "To store sequence of Positive Numerical Integer Values ranges(0,256)--allows us to store 0 to 256-1.<br>
-To store data in the object of bytearray data type, we don't have symbolic Notation but we can convert one type value into bytearray type value by using _bytearray()_.<br>
-On the object of bytearrray, we can perform both _Indexing and Slicing_ Operations.<br>
-An object of bytearray belongs to _mutable_ because 'bytearray' object does manipulations / updations.

**Note:The functionality of bytearray is exactly similar to bytes but an object of bytes belongs to _immutable_ and bytearray belongs to _mutable_.**
