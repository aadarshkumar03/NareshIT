**range:**<br>
-'range' is one of the pre-defined Data Type and treated as Sequence Data Type.<br>
-The prupose of range data type is that "To store range / sequence of values with equal interval".<br>
-On the object of range, we can perform both _Indexing and Slicing_ operations.<br>
-An object of range is _immutable_ because we can't change the value of range object.<br>
-range data type contains the following Syntaxes:<br>
_syntax-1_ varname=range(value)<br>
This syntax create an object of range by starting with 0 to value-1.<br>
_syntax-2_ varname=range(Begin,End)<br>
This syntax create an object of range by starting with Begin to End-1.<br>
_Note:"With Syntax-1 and Syntax-2 allows us to create the objects of range in forward direction  with default equal interval value 1."<br>
_Syntax-3:_ varname=range(Begin,End,Step)<br>
This syntax create an object of range by starting with Begin to End-1 by maintaining equal interval value "Stpe".
