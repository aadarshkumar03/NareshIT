**Importamce of Literals / Identifiers:** <br>
-To store the literals / Data in memory, Memory space is allocated by using Data types and Data stored in memory space.<br>
-To process the data, which is stored in memory space as a programmer we must give distinct names to created memory space and they make us the Identify the values and hence they are called _"Identifiers"_ . <br>
-The Identifier values can be varied during execution of the program and hence identifiers are also called as _"Variables"_. <br>
-Hence all types of INPUTs are store in main memory in the form of variables. In python programming all type variables are called _"Objects"_.<br>
_Def of Variable:_ A variable is an Identifier, whose values is changing during execution of the program.
