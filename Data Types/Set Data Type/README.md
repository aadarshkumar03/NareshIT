**IV) Set Data Type (Collection Data Type):**<br>
- The purpose of set data type is that "To store Multiple Values either of same type or different type or both the type with unique values".
- we have two set data types. They are:
    1. Set
    2. Frozenset

**Note:**
- **_The functionality of frozenset is similar to set but the set object belongs to Mutable (In case add()) and Immutable ( in the case of item assignment ) where an object frozenset belongs to Immutable._**
