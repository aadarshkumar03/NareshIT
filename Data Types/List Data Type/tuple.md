**2.tuple:**<br>
- 'tuple' is one of the pre-defined class and treated as List Data Type.
- The purpose of typle data type is that "To Store Multiple values either of same type or different type or both the types with unique and Duplicate Values".
- To organize the elements of tuple data type, we must use braces().
- In otherwords, the elements of tuple must be enclosed within braces () and seperated by comma.
- we can create tuple with following syntaxes:
  - tupleobj = tuple() (OR) <br>
  - tupleobj = ()
- An object of tuple maintains Insertion Order.
- On the object of tuple, we can perform both **_Indexing and Slicing_** Operations.
- An object of tuple belongs to **_Immutable_**.
- We can convert one type of value into tuple type of value by using **_tuple()_**.

**Pre-defined Functions in tuple:**<br>
**1. count(): tupleobj.count()**<br>
This function is used for finding number of occurences of specified element.

**2. index(): tupleobj.index(element)**<br>
This function is used for finding index of first occurence of specified element.<br>
If the element is not found in tuple object then we get ValueError.

**Inner (or) Nested tuple:**<br>
- The process of defining one or more number of tuples in another tuple is known as Inner / Nested tuple.
- On the inner tuple we can proform both **_Indexing and Slicing_** Operations.
- On the Inner tuple we can also apply pre-defined functions of tuple.
