**III) List Data Types (Collection Data Types):**<br>
-The Purpose of list data types is that "To store multiple values either of same type or different type or both the types with unique and duplicate values".<br>
-We have two types of List Data Types. They are<br>
1) list (mutable)<br>
2) tuple (immutable)

**Note:**
- **_The Functionality of tuple is exactly similar to list but an object of list belongs to Mutable and an object of tuple is Immutable_**.
