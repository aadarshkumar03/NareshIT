## Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Python:
- In real time, To develop any project, we need to choose a language and it can satisfy two types of principles. They are:
    1. Procedural Oriented Principles
    2. Object Oriented Principles
- In Otherwords, we have two types of programming languages. They are:
    1. Procedural Oriented Programming Languages
    2. Object Oriented Programming Languages

- Hence Python is one of the _Procedural (Functional) and Object Oriented Programming Language_.
- Even though, "Python is one of the Procedural and Object Oriented. Internally every thing is treated as _Objects_".

### Benefits of treating "Every thing is an Object in Python":
- Objects in python allows us to store un-limited amount of Data.
- The large volume of Data can be transferred between two remote applications all at once and we can get effective communication.
- When we transfer the confidential data in the form of object from one remote machine to another remote machine then it can be transferred in the form of _Cipher Text_(Encrypted format). So that security can be enhanced.
- By using Object Orientation, We can get high degree of re-usability (Through Functions, Modules, Packages)

### Python OOPs Principles  / Features / Concepts:
- To say a programmin language is Object oriented, It has to satisfy Object Oriented Principles. They are:
1. Class
2. Object
3. Data Encapsulation
4. Data Abstraction
5. Inheritance
6. Polymorphism
7. Message Passing
