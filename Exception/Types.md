## Types of Exception in Python:
- In python programming, we have two types of exceptions. They are
    - Pre-defined / Built-in Exceptions
    - Programmer / User / Custom Defined Exceptions

## 1. Pre-defined / Built-in Exceptions:
- These exceptions developed by Python Developers and available in python software and they are used always dealing with Universal Problems.
- Some of the Universal problems are :
<pre>
a) Division by Zero (ZeroDivisionError).
b) Invalid Literals / Number Formats (ValueError).
c) Invalid arguments (TypeError)
d) Invalid module names (ModuleNotFoundError)...etc</pre>
- In general, for every problem / invalid INPUT, there exists a pre-defined exception class.

## 2. Programmer / User / Custom Defined Exceptions:
- These exceptions developed by python programmers and available in Python Project and they are used always for dealing with common problems.
- Some of Common Problems are :
<pre>
a) Attempting to enter invalid PIN in atm application.
b) Attempting to enter invalid User and Password.
c) attempting to withdraw more amount than existing balance in account...etc</pre>
- In general, If END user enters valid INPUT then we get valid Output.
- If END user enters invalid INPUT then we generate exception and give User-Friendly Error Messages.
