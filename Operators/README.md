**Operators in python:**
- An operator is symbol, which is used for performing various Operations.
- An expresion is a collection of variables(objects) connected with an operator.
- In python programming, we have 7 Operators. They are:
    1. Arithmetic Operators
    2. Assignment Operators
    3. Relational Operators
    4. Logical Operators
    5. Bitwise Operators (MOST IMP)
    6. Membership operators
        - in
        - not in
    7. Identity Operators
        - is 
        - is not
   
**Note:**
- Python does not contain Unary Operator (++ --)
- Python does not contain Ternary operator (var=expr1?expr2:expr3)
- Python Ternary operator is (var1 if (test cond) else var2)
