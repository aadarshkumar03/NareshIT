**7) Identity Operators:**
- The Purpose of Identity Operators is that "To compare memory address of Objects".
- we have two types of Identity Operators. They are
    - is
    - is not

**a) is:**
- Syntax : obj1 is obj2
- This operator returns **"True"** provided both obj1 and obj2 contains same memory address otherwise it returns **"False"**.

**b) is not:**
- Syntax : obj1 is not obj2
- This operator returns **"True"** provided both obj1 and obj2 contains different memory address otherwise it returns **"False"**.
