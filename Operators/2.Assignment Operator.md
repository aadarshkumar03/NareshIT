**2) Assignment Operator:**
- This operator (=) is used for assigning Right Hand Side (RHS) value to Left Hand Side (LHS) variable.
- The assignment operator can be used in two ways. They are
    - single line assignment
    - multi line assignment

**a. Single Line Assignment:**
- This process, we assign single RHS value to LHS varaible.
- Syntax : 
    - varname = value
    - varname1 = varname2
    - varname = expression

**b. Multi Line Assignment:**
- This process, we assign Multiple RHS values to LHS variables.
- Syntax : 
    - var1, var2...var-n = val1, val2...val-n
    - var1, var2...var-n = Expr1, Expr2...Expr-n
- Here the value of val1, val2...val-n are assigned to var1, var2...var-n respectively.
