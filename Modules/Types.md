**Types of Modules:**
- In python, we have two types of modules. They are : 
    1. Pre-defined module
    2. Programmer-defined module

**1. Pre-defined Module:**
- These modules are already developed by Python Software Developers and available in Python Software and whose role is that to deal with the Universal Requirements.
- *Examples:* builtins, functools, calendar, math, random, cmath, re, cx=oracle, mysql-connector, threading, numpy, pandas...etc.

**2. Programmer-defined Modules:**
- These modules are developed by Python Language Programmers and available in Python Project and whose purpose / role is to deal with common Requirements.


**Creating Programmer-defined Modules:**
- Creating programmer-defined module in nothing but
    - a) Define / Choose the variables with values (Global Variables)
    - b) Define the Functions for performing common operations.
    - c) Define the Classes
    - Save File on some FileName with an extension *.py*. (Ex :- FileName.py)

- Hence Filename.py compiled Version *(Filename.cpython-310.py)* is treated as ModuleName.
- Once the module is created, whose module name is placed within a folder which is created automatically by Python Environment.
    - Examples:
    <pre>
    __pycache__
    filename.cpython-310.pyc
