**2. Looping / Iterative / Repeatative Statements:**
- The purpose of looping statements is that "To perform certain operations repeatadly until condition is False".
- In python, we have 2 types of looping statements. They are :
    - while (or) while...else
    - for (or) for...else
- While we are dealing with looping statements, we must ensure that there must exists three points. They are :
    - Initialization part
    - Conditional part
    - Updation part (Increment & Decrement)
- NOTE: Python programming does not contain do...while.

**a. while (or) while...else:**
- _Syntax-1:_
<pre>
-----
while (test condition):
    statement-1
    statement-2
    .
    .
    statement-n
Other statements in program</pre>

- _Syntax-2:_
<pre>
-----
while (test condition):
    statement-1
    statement-2
    .
    .
    statement-n
else:
    else block of statements
Other statements in program</pre>

- _Explanation:_
1. Here 'while' and 'else' are the keywords.
2. Test condition result may be True or False.
3. In the while loop. if test condition is True then PVM executes Indentation block of Statements and once again PVM control goes to test condition. If the test condition is True once again then PVM executes Indentation block of Statements once again and control again goes to test condition. This process will be continued until test condition False.
4. Once test condition becomes False then PVm executes else block of Statements, which are written in else block and later also executes Other Statements in program.

**b. for (or) for...else:**
- _Syntax-1:_
<pre>
for varname in Iterable_Object:
    Block of statements
Other statements in program.</pre>
- _Syntax-2:_
<pre>
for varname in Iterable_Object:
    Block of Statements
else:
    else Block of Statements
Other Statements in program</pre>

- _Explanation:_
1. Here 'for' and 'in' are the keywords.
2. The execution process of for loop is that "Each element of Iterable_Object kept in varname and executes Block of statements until all elements in Iterable_Object are completed.
3. After for...loop execution condition becomes False then PVM executes else block of statements (if we write else) and later executes Other statements in program.
