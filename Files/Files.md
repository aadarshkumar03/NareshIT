## Files in Python:
- The purpose of file is that _"To achieve the Data Persistancy"_.
- In the context of files, we have two types of applications. They are:
  - Non-Persistant applications
  - Persistant applications.

**Non-Persistant applications:**
- In Non-persistant development, we read the INPUTs from keyboard, stored in main memory and process the INPUTs and result and they are displayed in moniter.
- Whatever the data stored in main memory, it is temporary.

**Persistant applications:**
- In persistant application development, we read the INPUTs from keyboard, stored in main memory and process the INPUTs and results are stored permanently(Persistancy).

- In industry, we can store the data permanently in two ways. They are:
  - By using Files
  - By using Database Software

**Object vs Record:**
- All objects data of main memory becomes Record in files of secondary memory and all the records of files of secondary memory becomes objects in main memory.
